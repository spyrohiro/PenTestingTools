I created these bash scripts for hacktheboxs active subdomain enumeration and virtualhost challenges. 

Edit the domain, target address and only edit the flag if you want to use the recordenumerator with a different query. 
Create a nameservers.txt file with all nameservers you find (ns01, ns02) etc... 

For the virtualhosts script, edit the ip and domain. Create a wordlist youve generated using ffuf then run the script like this:
./virtualhostfuzzer.sh virtualhosts.txt 

If you want the flags from the challenge just grep the output:

./virtualhostfuzzer.sh virtualhosts.txt | grep "HTB" 

Dont run these on public networks you don't have permission to test on.
