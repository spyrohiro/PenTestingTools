I created these bash scripts for hacktheboxs active subdomain enumeration challenge. 

Edit the domain, target address and only edit the flag if you want to use the recordenumerator with a different query. 
Create a nameservers.txt file with all nameservers you find (ns01, ns02) etc... 

Dont run these on public networks you don't have permission to test on.
